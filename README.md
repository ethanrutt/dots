## Ethan's dots

- Various programs and their configuration files that I use for development

- Before you start
    - Probably want `WSL2`
    - Probably already have `git` installed
- Since this is the Linux branch, we will have
    - tmux
    - bash configuration
    - exa
    - bat
    - fzf
- Also check out my nvim-config
