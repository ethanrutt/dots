* I currently don't have this automated since it's on windows.
* These are configuration files for glaze window manager and zebar
* As of now, glazewm v3 is very new, and there is no winget or scoop installer
so the wm and bar must be downloaded manually 
[here](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)
* Also, these configuration files must be copied or linked to the home directory
